# 🛒 Grocery Shopping Cart — Track Your Items

A simple Python console program that allows a user to **manage a shopping list** interactively.
The program keeps track of items added, allows removal, preserves the order, and permits duplicates.



## 📌 **Project Overview**

This program helps a user:

* Add grocery items to their shopping cart
* Remove items if needed
* Allow duplicate entries for items
* View the final shopping list in the **exact order items were added**

It provides a simple, interactive experience using **Python lists and loops**



## 💡 **Features**

### ✔ Add Items ➕

The user can add items to the shopping list.
*Duplicates are allowed* — the same item can be added multiple times. ✅

### ✔ Remove Items ➖

The user can remove an item from the shopping list.
*If the item is not found, the program informs the user.* ⚠️

### ✔ Final Shopping List 📋

When the user quits the program, the program displays the **complete list of items in order**.

### ✔ Simple Command Interface 🖥️

Commands used in the program:

* Type the item name → Adds the item
* `remove` → Removes an item
* `q` → Quits the program


## 🛠️ **How the Program Works**

1. Keeps a **list of items** added to the shopping cart.
2. On adding, it **appends the item** to the list (duplicates allowed).
3. On removing, it **checks if the item exists** and removes it.
4. On quitting, it **prints the final shopping list** in the order items were added.



## 🎯 **Skills Practiced**

* Input handling
* Loops and conditional statements
* Working with **lists in Python**
* Preserving order and handling duplicates
* Basic interactive program flow
